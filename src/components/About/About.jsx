            My name is Aldo Alm√°nzar Rivera, and I am a full-stack software
            engineer and a graduate of the TripleTen Software Engineering
            bootcamp program. The NewsExplorer final project is a demonstration
            of my skills in building modern, responsive web applications using
            React.
          </p>
          <p className="about__text">
            Through this project, I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge of
            React hooks, API integration, and user authentication. I believe in
            the power of well-structured, maintainable code and a great user
            experience. Moreover, this project is a testament to my commitment
            to learning and building practical, impactful applications.
          </p>
          <p className="about__text">
            As my NewsExplorer final project shows, I also believe in the power
            of information and its ability to connect people and communities.
            Join me now in exploring the vast world of news!
